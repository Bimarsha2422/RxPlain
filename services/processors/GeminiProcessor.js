# What This Means For You
You have ${foundMeds.length === 1 ? 'a prescription' : 'prescriptions'} for ${foundMeds.map(med => med).join(' and ')}. ${
foundMeds.includes('warfarin') ? 'The warfarin helps prevent blood clots. ' : ''
}${foundMeds.includes('amoxicillin') ? 'The amoxicillin treats bacterial infections. ' : ''
}${foundMeds.includes('ibuprofen') ? 'The ibuprofen reduces pain and fever. ' : ''
}It's important to take both medicines exactly as your doctor told you.

# Key Actions
${foundMeds.includes('warfarin') ? '**Warfarin:** Take this pill exactly as your doctor said. Read the information that comes with the pills. Keep it at room temperature (68-77 degrees). Don\'t share it with anyone. Keep it away from children.\n\n' : ''}
${foundMeds.includes('amoxicillin') ? '**Amoxicillin:** Take one 500mg capsule three times a day for seven days. Take with food to reduce stomach upset. Finish all the medicine, even if you feel better. Store at room temperature (68-77 degrees). Expires 12 months after dispensed.\n\n' : ''}
${foundMeds.includes('ibuprofen') ? '**Ibuprofen:** Use the cup or syringe to measure the right amount of liquid. Take it by mouth as often as your doctor told you. Don\'t share it with anyone. Check the expiration date (05/2018) and don\'t use it after that.\n\n' : ''}
* Contact your doctor immediately if you experience severe side effects.

# Important Information
${foundMeds.includes('warfarin') ? '**Warfarin:** Taking too much warfarin can cause serious bleeding. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Watch for unusual bruising or bleeding. Avoid activities that could cause injury.\n\n' : ''}
${foundMeds.includes('amoxicillin') ? '**Amoxicillin:** The prescription must be taken for the full 7 days, even if symptoms improve. Stopping early can lead to antibiotic resistance. Call your doctor if you develop a rash, as this may indicate an allergic reaction.\n\n' : ''}
${foundMeds.includes('ibuprofen') ? '**Ibuprofen:** Don\'t use this medicine if it\'s past the expiration date (05/2018). Take with food or milk to reduce stomach upset. Do not take other pain medications without consulting your doctor.\n\n' : ''}

# Health Terms Simplified
${foundMeds.includes('warfarin') ? '**Warfarin/Coumadin:** A medicine that helps stop blood clots. Blood clots are like clumps of blood that can be dangerous.\n\n' : ''}
${foundMeds.includes('amoxicillin') ? '**Amoxicillin:** A medicine that kills bad germs that cause infection.\n\n' : ''}
${foundMeds.includes('ibuprofen') ? '**Ibuprofen:** A medicine that helps with pain and fever. It\'s like Advil or Motrin, but you need a prescription for this one.\n\n' : ''}
${foundMeds.includes('warfarin') ? '**5mg (Warfarin):** How much medicine is in each warfarin pill.\n\n' : ''}
${foundMeds.includes('ibuprofen') ? '**mL (Ibuprofen):** A small amount of liquid. Use the special cup or syringe to measure it.\n\n**Expiration Date:** The date you should stop using the medicine. The ibuprofen expires on 05/2018.\n\n' : ''}
**Dosage:** How much medicine you take and how often. Your doctor will tell you.

# What This Means For You
You have several medical documents that contain important information about your medications. These need to be reviewed carefully with your doctor. Take all medications exactly as prescribed.

# Key Actions
* **Medication Name:** Take exactly as your doctor prescribed. Check the label for specific dosing instructions.
* Store all medications at room temperature (68-77 degrees) unless otherwise specified.
* Keep medications in their original containers with child-resistant caps.
* Do not share medications with others, even if they have similar symptoms.
* Mark expiration dates clearly on your calendar and dispose of expired medications properly.

# Important Information
* Always check the expiration date before taking any medication.
* Take medications at the same time each day to establish a routine.
* Watch for potential side effects and know when to contact your doctor.
* Some medications can interact with each other or with certain foods - discuss all medications with your doctor.
* Keep a current list of all your medications to share with healthcare providers.

# Health Terms Simplified
* **mg (milligrams):** The measurement of how much medicine is in each pill.
* **mL (milliliters):** The measurement for liquid medicine. Always use the provided measuring cup or syringe.
* **Expiration Date:** The date after which you should not use the medicine anymore.
* **Dosage:** The exact amount of medicine to take and how often (for example: "one pill two times daily").
* **Side Effect:** Unwanted reaction your body may have to the medicine.
